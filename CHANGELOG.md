# Changelog

## 0.22.0 - 2026-04-28

### Performance

- Encode response time: 24.7ms to 15.2ms p50, about 40% faster.
- Cold-start first encode: 525ms to 28ms with warmup, about 18.7x faster.
- Hybrid recall: 30.2ms to 14.3ms p50, about 2.1x faster.
- Eliminated 3 of 4 redundant embedding calls during encode. Validation, interference, and affect resonance now reuse the main content vector.

### Added

- Added `memory_encode.wait_for_consolidation` parameter, default `false`, for opt-in read-after-write semantics.
- Added `memory_recall.retrieval` parameter with `"hybrid"` default, `"vector"`, and `"hybrid_strict"` modes.
- Added `pending_consolidation_count`, `embedding_warm`, `warmup_duration_ms`, and `default_retrieval_mode` to `memory_status`.
- Added background embedding pipeline warmup after MCP `server.connect()`.
- Added `AUDREY_PROFILE=1` for per-stage timings in MCP `_meta.diagnostics`.
- Added `AUDREY_DISABLE_WARMUP=1` to opt out of background embedding warmup.
- Added `benchmarks/perf.bench.js` and `npm run bench:perf` as a mock-embedding CI perf gate.

### Changed

- Moved post-encode validation, interference, and affect resonance onto a serialized async queue so `memory_encode` no longer blocks on downstream consolidation work by default.
- Folded recall's three healthy-store vec-table count queries into one SQL roundtrip before KNN.
- Process shutdown now drains the post-encode consolidation queue with a 5-second timeout and logs pending row IDs if work remains.

### Internal

- Added `src/profile.ts` with `ProfileRecorder`.
- Added `encodeWithDiagnostics()` and `recallWithDiagnostics()` for MCP profiling-mode response metadata.

## 0.21.0 - Release Diagnostics and Host Setup

- Added `npx audrey doctor` for first-contact diagnostics, JSON automation, provider checks, MCP entrypoint validation, memory-store health, and host config generation.
- Added `npx audrey install --host <host> --dry-run` so Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, JetBrains, and generic MCP hosts can preview setup without accidental config writes.
- Updated docs around the recommended first run: `doctor`, `demo`, safe host install preview, then host-specific verification.
- Kept Claude Code's direct installer intact while making the default release story host-neutral.
- Refreshed lockfile transitive packages through the npm resolver; vulnerability audit remains clean.

## 0.20.0 - Memory Reflexes

- Added Memory Preflight and Memory Reflexes so agents can check memory before acting and turn repeated failures into trigger-response guidance.
- Added Ollama/local-agent guidance and runnable local-agent example.
- Expanded host-neutral MCP docs and Audrey for Dummies onboarding.
