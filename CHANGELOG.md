# Changelog

## 0.22.1 - Unreleased

### Security

- HTTP `/v1/recall` and `/v1/capsule` no longer body-spread caller options into `audrey.recall()`. Pre-fix, `includePrivate: true` and `confidenceConfig` overrides could be passed in HTTP bodies, bypassing the private-memory ACL and integrity controls. The new `sanitizeRecallOptions()` allowlist drops anything not in a known-safe key set.
- `audrey serve` defaults to binding `127.0.0.1` (was `0.0.0.0`). Refuses to start on a non-loopback host without `AUDREY_API_KEY` unless `AUDREY_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=1`. New `AUDREY_HOST` env var explicitly opts in to network exposure.
- HTTP API key comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` instead of string `!==` to avoid prefix-match timing leaks on local untrusted callers.
- `audrey promote --yes` refuses to write `.claude/rules/*.md` outside `process.cwd()` unless the target path is in `AUDREY_PROMOTE_ROOTS`. Prevents a malicious MCP caller from writing persistent prompt-injection files into the user's `~/.claude/` directory.

### First-contact UX

- `audrey --help`, `audrey --version`, and `audrey help`/`audrey version` now print help/version and exit 0 instead of silently dropping into the MCP stdio server. Unknown subcommands print error + help and exit 2.
- ONNX runtime EP-assignment warnings ("Some nodes were not assigned to the preferred execution providers...") are suppressed by default via per-session `logSeverityLevel`. Set `AUDREY_ONNX_VERBOSE=1` to restore the original behavior.
- `[audrey-mcp]` info boot logs (server started, connected via stdio, warmup completed) are gated behind `AUDREY_DEBUG=1`. Warmup-failure errors continue to log unconditionally.

### Reliability

- `audrey.close()` now warns to stderr when called with pending post-encode consolidation work. New `audrey.closeAsync()` awaits `drainPostEncodeQueue()` before closing the database. All CLI subcommands (`reembed`, `dream`, `greeting`, `reflect`, `demo`, `observe-tool`, `promote`) use `closeAsync` to prevent the silent-data-loss race introduced in v0.22.0 where post-encode validation/interference could hit a closed DB.
- `_emitQueueError` reverted to the standard EventEmitter idiom: emit `error` when a listener is attached, fall back to `console.error` otherwise. v0.22.0 always called `console.error` and produced duplicate stderr lines for apps with structured error pipelines.
- `encodeBatch` now reuses the encode vector across post-encode stages and routes through `_enqueuePostEncode` (matching `encode`). Pre-fix, batch callers paid 4× embed cost per item and silently bypassed interference/resonance — a behavior divergence from single-encode that the v0.22.0 perf pass missed.

### Performance

- SQLite PRAGMA tuning at db creation: `synchronous=NORMAL` (durable under WAL), 64 MiB page cache, 256 MiB mmap, `temp_store=MEMORY`. Set `AUDREY_PRAGMA_DEFAULTS=0` to revert to better-sqlite3 defaults. Expected impact: 2-5× recall p95 at &gt;10K episodes; 30-50% improvement on encode under sustained load.

### Dependencies

- `sqlite-vec`: `0.1.7-alpha.2` → `0.1.9` (alpha to stable; the prior pin was 15 months old).
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: `1.26.0` → `1.29.0` (stricter schema validation, transport stability).
- `zod` `4.3.6` → `4.4.1`, `better-sqlite3` `12.6.2` → `12.9.0`, `hono` `4.12.14` → `4.12.15`, `@hono/node-server` `1.19.13` → `1.19.14`, `vitest` `4.0.18` → `4.1.5`, `typescript` `6.0.2` → `6.0.3`.
- `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities (production); transitive postcss CVE in vitest's vite resolved via `npm audit fix`.

### SDK contract fixes (Python ↔ TS server)

- Python client `DEFAULT_BASE_URL` corrected from `http://127.0.0.1:3487` to `http://127.0.0.1:7437` to match the TS server's default port. Pre-fix, calling `Audrey()` with no args connected to nothing.
- Python `recall()` and `recall_response()` now decode the bare-list payload that `/v1/recall` actually returns, then wrap into `RecallResponse` client-side. Pre-fix, `recall_response()` would raise a Pydantic validation error against the real server.
- Python `restore()` now wraps the snapshot in `{"snapshot": ...}` to match the TS `/v1/import` handler that reads `body.snapshot`. Pre-fix, the server received `body.snapshot === undefined` and `audrey.import(undefined)` failed.
- Python `analytics()` and `mark_used()` now raise `NotImplementedError` with a pointer to `docs/PRODUCTION_BACKLOG.md` (P0#1). Pre-fix, calling them produced cryptic 404s from the TS sidecar that doesn't expose those endpoints. They will become real once the closed-loop `memory_validate` primitive ships.
- README REST API row no longer claims `/openapi.json` or `/docs` — those routes aren't currently wired. The README now matches the actual surface (`/health` + `/v1/*`).

### Removed

- `hybrid_strict` retrieval mode (was a silent alias of `hybrid` with no behavioral difference). Use `hybrid` (default) or `vector`.

### Internal

- New `closeAsync(timeoutMs?: number)` on `Audrey`.
- New `sanitizeRecallOptions()` allowlist helper in `src/routes.ts`.
- `startServer` returns `hostname` alongside `port`.
- 5 new tests: CLI surface (`--help`/`--version`/unknown), HTTP recall sanitizer (privacy ACL, integrity, retrieval enum), HTTP bind safety (no-auth on LAN refused, `AUDREY_ALLOW_NO_AUTH` override).

## 0.22.0 - 2026-04-28

### Performance

- Encode response time: 24.7ms to 15.2ms p50, about 40% faster.
- Cold-start first encode: 525ms to 28ms with warmup, about 18.7x faster.
- Hybrid recall: 30.2ms to 14.3ms p50, about 2.1x faster.
- Eliminated 3 of 4 redundant embedding calls during encode. Validation, interference, and affect resonance now reuse the main content vector.

### Added

- Added `memory_encode.wait_for_consolidation` parameter, default `false`, for opt-in read-after-write semantics.
- Added `memory_recall.retrieval` parameter with `"hybrid"` default and `"vector"` (FTS-bypass fast path).
- Added `pending_consolidation_count`, `embedding_warm`, `warmup_duration_ms`, and `default_retrieval_mode` to `memory_status`.
- Added background embedding pipeline warmup after MCP `server.connect()`.
- Added `AUDREY_PROFILE=1` for per-stage timings in MCP `_meta.diagnostics`.
- Added `AUDREY_DISABLE_WARMUP=1` to opt out of background embedding warmup.
- Added `benchmarks/perf.bench.js` and `npm run bench:perf` as a mock-embedding CI perf gate.

### Changed

- Moved post-encode validation, interference, and affect resonance onto a serialized async queue so `memory_encode` no longer blocks on downstream consolidation work by default.
- Folded recall's three healthy-store vec-table count queries into one SQL roundtrip before KNN.
- Process shutdown now drains the post-encode consolidation queue with a 5-second timeout and logs pending row IDs if work remains.

### Internal

- Added `src/profile.ts` with `ProfileRecorder`.
- Added `encodeWithDiagnostics()` and `recallWithDiagnostics()` for MCP profiling-mode response metadata.

## 0.21.0 - Release Diagnostics and Host Setup

- Added `npx audrey doctor` for first-contact diagnostics, JSON automation, provider checks, MCP entrypoint validation, memory-store health, and host config generation.
- Added `npx audrey install --host <host> --dry-run` so Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, JetBrains, and generic MCP hosts can preview setup without accidental config writes.
- Updated docs around the recommended first run: `doctor`, `demo`, safe host install preview, then host-specific verification.
- Kept Claude Code's direct installer intact while making the default release story host-neutral.
- Refreshed lockfile transitive packages through the npm resolver; vulnerability audit remains clean.

## 0.20.0 - Memory Reflexes

- Added Memory Preflight and Memory Reflexes so agents can check memory before acting and turn repeated failures into trigger-response guidance.
- Added Ollama/local-agent guidance and runnable local-agent example.
- Expanded host-neutral MCP docs and Audrey for Dummies onboarding.
